# HeadCount 2.0

In this project, we were given a static data file and asked to dynmically render the data using React. The data files contained education data for the state of Colorado and we had to compare data between different state districts. We imported the data, cleaned the data, and then used React and javascript to implement a card comparison UI as outline in the specification. We made changes to the spec to increase usability and adhere to the 10 essential web application usability guidelines. We also build a comprehensive unit and integration testing suite to test all components in the app. To do this, we used Jest, Enzyme, and the Enzyme adapter. We also built this project using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate.
